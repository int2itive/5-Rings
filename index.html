            <p><strong>Musashi's First Principle: Do Not Think Dishonestly</strong></p>
            <p>Lying to others is bad enough. But lying to yourself destroys your life.</p>
          </article>
          <p><strong>Musashi #2: The Way Is In Training</strong></p>
            <p>The second principle is "The Way is in training."</p>
          <p>The "Way", (the path, the door, the goal, the method.) is in ceaseless, daily effort.  There is a great scene in John Steinbeck's WW2 memoir "Once There Was a War."  In it, he describes the expression on the face of a naval cook, when he realizes there is no way to "feed a man once and for all."  Loved that.  The concept of ceaseless, incremental daily improvement, or constant engagement with the processes of life, goes back to every wise person in every culture since the beginning of time.  "Before Enlightenment, chop wood and carry water.  After 
    enlightenment, chop wood and carry water."  The tasks of life go on, and it is in engaging with them that our momentum is maintained. Just try slacking off after you've gained fitness.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at this second principle in our three arenas.</p>
          <p>1) <strong>Body</strong>.  You need to stretch, move, connect with your body EVERY DAY.  You should stress it at least a couple of times a week, and build to "peaks" a few times a year, just allowing a gentle fluctuation of intensity.  Treated like this, constantly seeking to learn something new about the body-mind connection, is enough to keep you busy for a thousand years.</p>
          <p>2) <strong>Career/Mind</strong>.  Well, we're being specific to writing.  Write every day.  Write a story a week, or a thousand words a day.  Constantly seek to improve in small ways.  Seek higher and higher levels of criticism and feedback.  <strong><em>Improve your resistance to failure, fear, and disappointment</em></strong>.  Work to tap more deeply into your creativity.  Every damned day.</p>
          <p>3) <strong>Spirit/Relationship</strong>.  I start every day with meditation.  Finding that calm center within me, that connection with the divine, that essence that is, in actuality, the only thing any of us need.  Connecting with that space erases fear of abandonment or rejection. Failing to make that connection leads one to believing that outside relationships will complete us.  They will not.  We must complete ourselves, otherwise we will attract only wounded people to us.  Otherwise, we will pass our fears and neediness on to our children. Otherwise, we will reinforce our dear 
    friend's dysfunction, because we need them to reinforce ours.  We will live lives of quiet desperation, and begin to consider our wounds to be spiritual strengths.  But beyond that, relationships, friendships, love, marriages, require daily work.  You have to be there emotionally, physically, financially, mentally, energetically.  All it takes to have a healthy relationship is everything you've got, every day, with complete honesty, compassion, and self-confidence.  This is why I consider our relationships to be our best and finest mirrors for who we are.</p>

            <p><strong>Musashi #3: Become acquainted with every art</strong></p>
            <p>I've seen this translated as "every martial art" or "every fine art form."  The implications are different, and let's see why.  If a warrior becomes familiar with all other martial arts forms, he starts seeing how there is a single 360-degree rotating sphere of motion, comprising throws, locks, holds, punches, kicks, etc. Add weapons and you have stabbing, slashing and striking--extrapolations on the empty-hand motions.</p>
            <p>From a further distance you have arrows and spears--extrapolations of rock-throwing, which are extrapolations of punching: the joints rotate in sequence, and technique translates rotary to linear momentum. Guns, of course, lift the entire equation to another level: they barely depend upon muscular strength, or in some cases even coordination.They have more in common with catapults--in other words, a purely mechanical approach to killing.  Somewhere within these arenas will be found most of the tools of warfare, or the things that a warrior will deal with.</p>
            <p>But a warrior (by my definition) is one willing to kill or die for what he believes in, his dearest values. That means that he is also happily prepared to live in the world, seeks peace, hopes for a bloodless victory. That means that politics (my personal weak suit), commerce, interpersonal communication, spiritual harmony, and other factors must be at optimum level--n the sense that war is always a failure of diplomacy.  The position of warrior should be one of a balanced series of options for a human being--including healer, teacher, lover, merchant. Some of us will specialize in one position or another, but all of us should, in emergency, be able to fill in. (Emergency lovers, anyone?)</p>
            <p>To this end, then, we should all strive to be, as the Chinese say, "Masters of the five Excellences"--or folk committed to a balanced path. Much of the deep nature of human beings is revealed in their art works.  I would say that anywhere excellence is to be found, you should be sniffing about.  Painting, writing, acting, dancing, photography...can you converse with people in these different fields, learn what they think creates excellence?  And if you speak to enough different ones, can you begin to read "between the lines" and sense the path that leads to excellence in ANY endeavour?</p>

            <p><strong>Musashi #4 : Know the Ways of all professions</strong></p>
            <p>Wow.  this is a fine and wonderful principle for several reasons.</p>
            <p>1) First of all, if you re interested specifically in martial arts, this principle will lead you to investigate the question of excellence. How is it that people succeed and fail in the world?  Excellence, and the pursuit thereof, is separate from any specific application</p>
            <p>2) Knowing the different ways that people earn a living helps us to understand human nature itself.  We all sell, we all produce.  We all attempt to protect the proceeds of our labour.  Understanding this, and the things that human beings do to try to increase safety for themselves and their families will help you to understand human motivations.  When you understand that, it is far easier to avoid conflict...and in essence, not NEED to fight as often.</p>
            <p>3)  What if you are interested in the arts, say, writing?  Well, how much more obvious could it be?  The more you understand about different professions, the easier it is to write about them convincingly.</p>
            <p>4) Moreover, remember that your customers make their livings in some way other than writing. You must learn to communicate with people who see the world differently.</p>
            <p>5) Being genuinely interested in other people makes YOU interesting. You can always find something to talk about at a party--just ask questions about other people's lives.  Being interested in them make you automatically a less self-centered person.  and helps you build rapport rapidly.</p>

            <p><strong>Musashi #5: distinguish between gain and loss in worldly matters</strong></p>
            <p>Again, this is just incredibly common-sensical, and I find it simply amazing how many people don't take care of business here.  Simply put, what does a positive or negative result look like in your endeavour?  Do you know when you're getting closer to your goal or further away?  FEEDBACK, friends. Feedback.  One presentation of the Ultimate Success Formula is:</p>
