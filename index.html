            <p><strong>Musashi's First Principle: Do Not Think Dishonestly</strong></p>
            <p>Lying to others is bad enough. But lying to yourself destroys your life.</p>
          </article>
          <p><strong>Musashi #2: The Way Is In Training</strong></p>
            <p>The second principle is "The Way is in training."</p>
          <p>The "Way", (the path, the door, the goal, the method.) is in ceaseless, daily effort.  There is a great scene in John Steinbeck's WW2 memoir "Once There Was a War."  In it, he describes the expression on the face of a naval cook, when he realizes there is no way to "feed a man once and for all."  Loved that.  The concept of ceaseless, incremental daily improvement, or constant engagement with the processes of life, goes back to every wise person in every culture since the beginning of time.  "Before Enlightenment, chop wood and carry water.  After 
    enlightenment, chop wood and carry water."  The tasks of life go on, and it is in engaging with them that our momentum is maintained. Just try slacking off after you've gained fitness.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at this second principle in our three arenas.</p>
          <p>1) <strong>Body</strong>.  You need to stretch, move, connect with your body EVERY DAY.  You should stress it at least a couple of times a week, and build to "peaks" a few times a year, just allowing a gentle fluctuation of intensity.  Treated like this, constantly seeking to learn something new about the body-mind connection, is enough to keep you busy for a thousand years.</p>
          <p>2) <strong>Career/Mind</strong>.  Well, we're being specific to writing.  Write every day.  Write a story a week, or a thousand words a day.  Constantly seek to improve in small ways.  Seek higher and higher levels of criticism and feedback.  <strong><em>Improve your resistance to failure, fear, and disappointment</em></strong>.  Work to tap more deeply into your creativity.  Every damned day.</p>
          <p>3) <strong>Spirit/Relationship</strong>.  I start every day with meditation.  Finding that calm center within me, that connection with the divine, that essence that is, in actuality, the only thing any of us need.  Connecting with that space erases fear of abandonment or rejection. Failing to make that connection leads one to believing that outside relationships will complete us.  They will not.  We must complete ourselves, otherwise we will attract only wounded people to us.  Otherwise, we will pass our fears and neediness on to our children. Otherwise, we will reinforce our dear 
    friend's dysfunction, because we need them to reinforce ours.  We will live lives of quiet desperation, and begin to consider our wounds to be spiritual strengths.  But beyond that, relationships, friendships, love, marriages, require daily work.  You have to be there emotionally, physically, financially, mentally, energetically.  All it takes to have a healthy relationship is everything you've got, every day, with complete honesty, compassion, and self-confidence.  This is why I consider our relationships to be our best and finest mirrors for who we are.</p>

            <p><strong>Musashi #3: Become acquainted with every art</strong></p>
            <p>I've seen this translated as "every martial art" or "every fine art form."  The implications are different, and let's see why.  If a warrior becomes familiar with all other martial arts forms, he starts seeing how there is a single 360-degree rotating sphere of motion, comprising throws, locks, holds, punches, kicks, etc. Add weapons and you have stabbing, slashing and striking--extrapolations on the empty-hand motions.</p>
            <p>From a further distance you have arrows and spears--extrapolations of rock-throwing, which are extrapolations of punching: the joints rotate in sequence, and technique translates rotary to linear momentum. Guns, of course, lift the entire equation to another level: they barely depend upon muscular strength, or in some cases even coordination.They have more in common with catapults--in other words, a purely mechanical approach to killing.  Somewhere within these arenas will be found most of the tools of warfare, or the things that a warrior will deal with.</p>
            <p>But a warrior (by my definition) is one willing to kill or die for what he believes in, his dearest values. That means that he is also happily prepared to live in the world, seeks peace, hopes for a bloodless victory. That means that politics (my personal weak suit), commerce, interpersonal communication, spiritual harmony, and other factors must be at optimum level--n the sense that war is always a failure of diplomacy.  The position of warrior should be one of a balanced series of options for a human being--including healer, teacher, lover, merchant. Some of us will specialize in one position or another, but all of us should, in emergency, be able to fill in. (Emergency lovers, anyone?)</p>
            <p>To this end, then, we should all strive to be, as the Chinese say, "Masters of the five Excellences"--or folk committed to a balanced path. Much of the deep nature of human beings is revealed in their art works.  I would say that anywhere excellence is to be found, you should be sniffing about.  Painting, writing, acting, dancing, photography...can you converse with people in these different fields, learn what they think creates excellence?  And if you speak to enough different ones, can you begin to read "between the lines" and sense the path that leads to excellence in ANY endeavour?</p>

            <p><strong>Musashi #4 : Know the Ways of all professions</strong></p>
            <p>Wow.  this is a fine and wonderful principle for several reasons.</p>
            <p>1) First of all, if you re interested specifically in martial arts, this principle will lead you to investigate the question of excellence. How is it that people succeed and fail in the world?  Excellence, and the pursuit thereof, is separate from any specific application</p>
            <p>2) Knowing the different ways that people earn a living helps us to understand human nature itself.  We all sell, we all produce.  We all attempt to protect the proceeds of our labour.  Understanding this, and the things that human beings do to try to increase safety for themselves and their families will help you to understand human motivations.  When you understand that, it is far easier to avoid conflict...and in essence, not NEED to fight as often.</p>
            <p>3)  What if you are interested in the arts, say, writing?  Well, how much more obvious could it be?  The more you understand about different professions, the easier it is to write about them convincingly.</p>
            <p>4) Moreover, remember that your customers make their livings in some way other than writing. You must learn to communicate with people who see the world differently.</p>
            <p>5) Being genuinely interested in other people makes YOU interesting. You can always find something to talk about at a party--just ask questions about other people's lives.  Being interested in them make you automatically a less self-centered person.  and helps you build rapport rapidly.</p>

            <p><strong>Musashi #5: distinguish between gain and loss in worldly matters</strong></p>
            <p>Again, this is just incredibly common-sensical, and I find it simply amazing how many people don't take care of business here.  Simply put, what does a positive or negative result look like in your endeavour?  Do you know when you're getting closer to your goal or further away?  FEEDBACK, friends. Feedback.  One presentation of the Ultimate Success Formula is:</p>
            <p>1) Choose a goal.</p>
            <p>2) Learn the behaviours and beliefs that will lead to the goal.</p>
            <p>3) Analyze your current behaviors and beliefs, and see what the difference is. Then, commit to either changing the goal, or changing the beliefs and behaviours.  Get the point? If your actions are not in alignment with your intentions, start changing one or the other, or you're in serious crap.</p>
            <p>4) Raise your energy level.</p>
            <p>5) Begin to live as if the beliefs and behaviors are yours. All kindsa techniques work here: NLP, and positive thinking, and Psycho-Cybernetics, and self-hypnosis and affirmations, and God knows what all.  They all work, if you pay attention.</p>
            <p>6) Keep tabs of your results.  Do they take you toward or away from your goal?  Do you actually even do what you're committed to doing, separate from the issue of the efficiency of the act?  YOU MUST GAIN SENSITIVITY TO THIS.</p>
            <p>7) Fail successfully.  Push yourself until the behaviours and habits break down.  "Test to failure."  Then...</p>
            <p>8)  Start over again.</p>
            <p>This Success Cycle will, with proper learning and effort, take you about anywhere you want to go. But it works if you pay attention, if you learn to know when things are going well, and when they're not...and more importantly, know what is actually important. What things will actually bring you closer to your goal?  What is REALLY winning in life.  Some people would say that getting into an accident because you refused to let some idiot cut them off on the freeway is "winning."  For others, getting home alive and safe is the prize. Be VERY clear on what is and is not important in life. Listen to the men and women who have led healthy, happy, successful lives. Chose them carefully. Listen to what they say about what matters. And if you find that is greatly different from the way you see life or deal with the world? Consider changing.</p>

            <p><strong>Musashi #8 Pay attention even to little things</strong></p>
            <p>"The Devil is in the Details" as they say. There are moments in the learning of a skill where the large details dominate. And then there is another point where you have mastered the larger aspects, and it is the tiny things that make the difference. A teacher cannot communicate in words things for which there are no shared reference (this is one of the things that makes watching a child learn to speak so wonderful--the understanding that she is actually building a map of the world, not merely memorizing sounds like a parrot.  No offense to parrots.)</p>
            <p>In many cases, it is only by imitating tiny things that a teacher does that we begin to mirror the internal states that CREATES those external effects. For swordsman Musashi, tiny adjustments in hand position or angulation could make the difference between life and death. For a writer, the precise choice of words ("the difference between the right word and the almost-right word is like the difference between lightning and a lightning bug") can spell failure or success in a career. And in relationships, well, let's say tiny cues during sex can tell you if you're on the right track toward a gloriously orgastic experience for your partner, or an "is that all there is?" expression prior to ushering you out the door.</p>
            <p>We are working toward full human potential here, and while there are large structures (body, mind, spirit) there individual variations are almost infinite, and the refinements will take a lifetime to explore.  Every day, you should be looking for ways to be more joyful, energetic, efficient, creative, loving, sharing, powerful, honest, committed. And the way to do that is to, while keeping control of whatever large issues are easy to see, be constantly searching for those little details. Gather them unto yourself, master them, and make that 1% per week shift that will take you to the next level.</p>

            <p><strong>Musashi #9: Do Nothing that is of no use</strong></p>
            <p>This should be painfully obvious, but is not. Don't waste your time and energy. How many times do we spend great effort to accomplish something that was never worth our time to begin with? "There are battles it is not worth winning" is a great motto. Worse still is to LOSE such a battle.</p>
            <p>To that end, you have to be very careful, and to know which activities will actually lead you to your goal--and which will not. Until you have made this evaluation, it is best not to act. Measure twice, cut once. Distinguish between gain and loss. All of this leads to the idea of doing the minimum amount to get the maximum result. It would be possible to spend a lifetime mastering this single lesson.</p>
            <p>1) Exercise: know what behaviours and attitudes actually produce results. Be clear on the results you want.</p>
            <p>2) Relationship: Learn to communicate in the language your partner uses. There is no point in communicating in YOUR own mode, unless the other person can decode it. If she wants flowers, don't bring candy. If he needs to talk, don't suggest dancing.</p>
            <p>3) Career. In writing, learn to use the precise language. Don't use five words if three will do. Cut all extraneous characters, scenes, whatever. Be prepared to kill your favorite scenes. Cut, Cut, Cut.</p>
